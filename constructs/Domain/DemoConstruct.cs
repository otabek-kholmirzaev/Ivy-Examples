/// Represents a demonstration construct that builds a small construct tree for examples and tests.

/// <code>
/// Root
///  └─ Demo
///     ├─ ChildA
///     ├─ ChildB
///     └─ Nested
///        ├─ Leaf1
///        └─ Leaf2
/// </code>
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This type is intended for examples and unit tests that need a predictable construct hierarchy.
/// It does not perform any validation or side effects beyond creating child constructs.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
/// var root = DemoConstruct.BuildRoot();
/// // root now contains a Demo construct with two direct children (ChildA, ChildB)
/// // and a Nested construct containing Leaf1 and Leaf2.
